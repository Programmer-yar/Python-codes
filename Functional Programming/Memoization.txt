MEMOIZATION EXPLAINED
Memoization is whereby the result of a previous section can be referred and used to get the result of the next without having to go through a lot of work.
Example.
If you write
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
and asked for an answer, you will take time to do that and get 10
Now if I add another +1 at the end
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
You will instantly say 11
That is memoization. You will not go back to adding the whole list of 1s.
Practical example can be in calculation of factorials.
Once you know that 3! is 6 (ie 1 * 2 * 3) then if I asked you 4! you simply take 3! * 4 = 24 other than doing it over again as 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
Now let us apply Memoization:
9! = 362880
find 10!
Answer: Simply 9! * 10 = 3628800
